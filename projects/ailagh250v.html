              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Machine’s purpose of using machine tools is for the high quality
                and mass production that human power can’t follow. That is what
                machine is meant to be. However, those convenient machine is
                sometimes unfamiliar to the people because of the size and form.
                Most of the heavy equipment’s price is incredibly expensive. So,
                for the cost down, they make the outer shape as simple as
                possible, which ends up with creating ugly and dull machine
                appearance. Although they believe machine tools have been
                designed in a user-friendly way but unfortunately, their design
                has been done not by designers and but by engineers. This means
                only a few things from engineers’ point of view have been taken
                into consideration in term of user-friendliness of machine
                tools. Therefore, our new design of AGH250V tried to radically
                improve the appearance and ease to use of the hobbing machine by
                breaking people’s common sense that heavy machines or equipment
                has little to do with aesthetics and ease to use. We added curvy
                shape and distinctive colors in order to escape heavy and dull
                feelings and to deliver soft and warm emotions to the user. Our
                focus was on the balance between aesthetics and usability.
