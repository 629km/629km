              <h3>Overview</h3>
              <p>
                Due to the increase in the number of single households, many
                products in the market are suitable for a family. Since laundry
                and cleaning were a problem for them as well, they are using the
                money for a comfortable life. Easy Dry-O can help single
                household's work by providing a dry bathroom and the ability to
                dry clothes and feet. The products used for family size are big
                and wasteful for a single household, it is a reality that they
                hesitate to buy family size product. For that reason, among
                them, some of them are doing hand wash their daily laundry, so
                they use the drying rack, but sometimes, laundry is too many for
                laundry rack to handle. That's why I designed the Easy Dry-O to
                solve problems and solve other problems as well. The hot air
                from the Easy Dry-O is used to dry the feet immediately after
                bathing and dry the humid bathroom quickly. It also dries the
                underwear and sportswear as well.
